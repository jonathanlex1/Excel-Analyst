**What is the distribution of the number of reviews received by the books?**
-	The distribution of the number of reviews indicates that a small subset of books dominates reader engagement. Two titles—Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th Edition and The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts—received the highest review counts, with 10 reviews each. This is followed closely by StrengthsFinder 2.0 with 9 reviews, and Oh, the Places You’ll Go! with 8 reviews. Several popular titles, including The Very Hungry Caterpillar and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, garnered 7 reviews each. The majority of other books in this list received between 5 and 6 reviews, reflecting a moderate but consistent level of reader interaction across the dataset.

This price point significantly exceeds that of other titles, with the second-highest being The Twilight Saga Collection at $82.00.
